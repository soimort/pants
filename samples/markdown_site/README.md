# README

## How

[String](https://github.com/soimort/string) is embedded in `Makefile` already, together with all the necessary configuration. Build the site with the Markdown engine of your choice: (e.g. Redcarpet)

    $ make ENGINE=redcarpet

You'll find everything the web server needs in `_site/`. Also, you can preview the site using a temporary server: (Ruby required)

    $ make ENGINE=redcarpet server

## What

Explanation on the directory structure: (names used here are specific to this demo site and its `Makefile` configuration; you _don't have to_ do naming this way)

* `README.md`
  * Markdown source files (`*.md`) can be put anywhere in any directory (except for a directory whose name starts with an underscore "`_`", which is ignored by the generator)
  * A Markdown file always translates to its corresponding path on the server, e.g., `README.md` -> `/README.html`
* `index.md`
  * `index.md` translates to `/index.html`, which is the default page served by many web servers (as a convention)
* `index.head`
  * A Markdown file may have an accompanying `.head` file, which contains the HTML code to be inserted into the `<head>` element of the representing page (for most use cases, it contains a `<title>` element)
  * A Markdown file may have an accompanying `.include-before` file, which contains the HTML code to be inserted into the `<body>` element of the representing page, *before* the content generated by the Markdown file
  * A Markdown file may have an accompanying `.include-before` file, which contains the HTML code to be inserted into the `<body>` element of the representing page, *after* the content generated by the Markdown file
* `stories/`
  * `black-cat.md`
  * `black-cat.head`
      * As explained before: `black-cat.md` -> `/stories/black-cat.html`
  * `tell-tale-heart.md`
  * `tell-tale-heart.head`
      * As explained before: `tell-tale-heart.md` -> `/stories/tell-tale-heart.html`
* `_templates/`
  * `main.head`
      * The template `.head` file contains the HTML code to be inserted into the `<head>` element of every page on the site (for most use cases, it contains elements such as `<meta>`, `<link>`, etc.)
  * `main.include-before`
      * The template `.include-before` file contains the HTML code to be inserted into the `<body>` element of every page on the site, *before* the content generated for a specific page
  * `main.include-after`
      * The template `.include-after` file contains the HTML code to be inserted into the `<body>` element of every page on the site, *after* the content generated for a specific page
* `css/`
* `images/`
  * Any non-Markdown file in any directory (except for a directory whose name starts with an underscore "`_`", which is ignored by the generator) is copied directly into the output directory
* `_site/`
  * The output directory, which can be served as static site

## Why

Because fancy static site generators never help you write a good blog. Stop toying with them. Focus on writing. Be the master of your own content.
